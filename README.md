# Hi there 👋 I am Akhilesh

I am a Software Engineer with 14 years of experience in building and shipping high quality software products in fast paced and ambiguous environments.

Currently, I am working at [LeapThought](https://www.leapthought.com) as Lead Software Architect. LeapThought is a deep-tech company which is transforming Architecture, Engineering & Construction industry.

I have a Bachelor's of Engineering degree in Computer Science & Technology from [CSVTU](https://csvtu.ac.in/)

## My Interests

### Technologies

- 🛠 I'm passionate about **modern [.Net](https://github.com/dotnet)** Platform
- ⌨️ I love **[C#](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang)**. Its a powerful language that offers a clean syntax similar to C++, the memory management efficiency of Java, and the power of Lambda expressions for functional programming
- 🐍 I like **[Python](https://github.com/python)** and **[Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)** since you can write any application in minutes, great for prototyping

### Environment

- 🖥 I currently use Windows 11 as my operating system
- ⌨️ [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) is my IDE of choice for backend development
- ⌨️ [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my IDE of choice for frontend development, or for any script editing
- 💻 I love working on [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) as it brings all my command-line tools and shells in one place.
- 🌱 [Git](https://github.com/git/git) for revision control

### Culture

- 🎢 I like a startup like environment with low hierarchies and lean processes
- 💯 Focus on [clean code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code) and best practices
- 🛣 Favor paying down technical debt and improving daily work over feature development
- 🌍 I'm working 100% remotely and enjoy working from my home-office, but I do like to catch up with my colleagues in office once in a while
- 🏖 I am all for a healthy **work-life-balance** (work hard during weekdays, no work on weekends and holidays)!

### My reading list

- [Scarlet Ink](https://www.scarletink.com/) to get rare inside view into how senior leadership works at Big Tech
